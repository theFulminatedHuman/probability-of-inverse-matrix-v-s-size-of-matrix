# probability-of-inverse-matrix-v-s-size-of-matrix
The problem statement for this question was actually asked in my Linear Algebra tutorial(MA110). This is an intersting problem in which we have to fill randomly 1s and 0s in any nXn matrix and then we have to compute probability of an inverse matrix.
Here is the exact problem statement:
(a) There are sixteen 2 by 2 matrices whose entries are 1’s and 0’s. How many are invertible?
(b) If you put 1’s and 0’s at random into the entries of a 10 by 10 matrix, is it more likely to
be invertible or singular?
The (a) part is quite but damn the (b) part.
So to visualize the second I went on to code it in python to actually see the proabability. And also plotted the curve of proabability vs size.
Intersting curve I must say.
